GAWFA is the leading and the first Micro finance institution established in 1987 in The Gambia. The total Membership of  GAWFA is over 49,000 members and the active borrowers are  over 14,780 (96% of who are women).GAWFA has branch offices spread throughout The Gambia.

 
Why we are working on this problem: 
GAWFA has never had an integrated system to consolidate the financial and operational transactions, and has over the years been tracking loans given to members through a manual system that is done in with an excel sheet Due to the methods of data entry and management, a lot of errors crop up, and the generation of reports is a slow and tedious task.
